## Usage

When the user visits the webpage, they are presented with a search bar, as the default page, as well as buttons to login or signup in the Navbar. Without logging in, the user is able to search for any book by using the search form, and they will be presented with various books based on title in relation to the search input. In addition to the title, each entry will also feature a description of the book, any authors, and an image of the book. If the user chooses to login or signup, a popup will appear prompting them to input their information. When logged in, after searching for a book, the user will also be able to save the book to their account. This will allow the user to see the book with any other books that have been saved on a separate page when they click on See Your Books in the Navbar. Here, any books that have been saved by the user will be rendered here, as well as the ability to remove them. Books that have been saved are account-specific, so different users may save different books. The user is able to log out as well, thus losing the ability to save and view saved books.
